Null Hypothesis (H0): The null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference between the mean of the sample and the hypothesized population mean. Mathematically, it can be represented as: H0: μ = μ0, where μ is the population mean, and μ0 is the hypothesized mean.

Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis and states that there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean. Mathematically, it can be represented as: Ha: μ ≠ μ0 (for a two-tailed test) or Ha: μ > μ0 (for a one-tailed test).

Calculate the Sample Mean (x̄): Compute the mean of the sample data.

Calculate the Sample Standard Deviation (s): Calculate the standard deviation of the sample data.

Calculate the Standard Error of the Mean (SE): The standard error of the mean measures the uncertainty or variability of the sample mean.
Calculate the t-statistic: The t-statistic is a measure of how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the hypothesized population mean. It is calculated as: t = (x̄ - μ0) / (SE).

Determine the Degrees of Freedom (df): The degrees of freedom represent the number of independent pieces of information available for estimating the population parameter. For a one-sample t-test, the degrees of freedom is (n - 1), where n is the sample size.

Look up the Critical Value or p-value: Use the t-distribution table or a statistical software to find the critical t-value corresponding to the chosen significance level (α) and degrees of freedom. Alternatively, you can calculate the p-value associated with the t-statistic using the t-distribution.

Make a Decision: Compare the obtained t-statistic with the critical t-value or use the p-value to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis or not. If the t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value (or the p-value is less than the significance level α), then reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

Interpret the Results: If you reject the null hypothesis, it suggests that the sample mean is significantly different from the hypothesized population mean. If you fail to reject the null hypothesis, it means there is not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean.
